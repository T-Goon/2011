# HW2 Bomblab

The goal of this assignment is to analyze the bomb program with a debugger and read the assembly to find out the passwords to defuse the bomb.
There are 6 phases to defuse. The solutions that I found to this bomb are stored in "sol.txt".

More details about this assignement can be found in "bomblab.pdf".
